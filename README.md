# 🏗️ EstateChain – Real Estate. Reinvented.

**EstateChain** is a blockchain-powered real estate launchpad that enables fractional investment, decentralized governance, and passive income from tokenized property assets.

We are reshaping how people invest in, co-own, and profit from real estate — by putting it all on-chain.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Traditional real estate is slow, expensive, and heavily centralized.  
EstateChain brings a new model of ownership to the market — one that is:

- Accessible  
- Transparent  
- Decentralized  
- Global

With EstateChain, users can participate in real estate funding rounds, own property fractions via tokens, and vote on decisions through a DAO structure.

## 🔩 Core Features

### 1. **Real Estate Launchpad**
Property owners list their apartments or homes for tokenized investment rounds. Each listing includes:
- Pricing & funding targets
- Investment conditions
- Sale model (full / partial)

### 2. **Tokenization**
Properties are divided into a fixed number of tokens, representing fractional ownership. Investors can purchase these tokens and receive:
- Voting rights
- Revenue share
- Tradeable tokens (liquidity)

### 3. **DAO Governance**
After successful fundraising:
- The property is managed by a DAO
- Token holders vote on: renovations, rental strategies, resale, or reinvestment
- Decisions are based on token weight (1 token = 1 vote)

### 4. **Passive Income**
Revenue from rent or sales is distributed proportionally to token holders.  
The DAO can also vote on:
- Payout schedules
- Use of profits
- Long-term asset strategy
